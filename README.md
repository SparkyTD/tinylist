# Tiny List

A minimalistic, no-nonsense todo/shopping list app for Android. Because managing lists shouldn't require a subscription.

## What it does

Tiny List is a straightforward list management app that:
- Creates and manages multiple named lists
- Adds/removes items from lists
- Checks/unchecks items
- Supports optional quantities and units
- Has a clean, simple interface that gets out of your way
- Works offline
- Respects your privacy
- Is completely free and open source

## What it doesn't do

Tiny List deliberately does not include:
- AI
- Ads
- Subscription fees
- Mandatory account creation
- Data collection
- Any form of analytics or telemetry
- Social features
- Pointless gamification
- Annoying popups
- "Premium" features
- Or any other unnecessary bloat
