- Specify quantities and units for items (optional)
- Clean, minimalist interface
- Fully offline: all data stays on your device

- AI
- Ads
- "Premium" features
- Subscription fees
- Account creation requirements
- Analytics or any form of data collection
- Social features you didn't ask for
- Gamification nobody wanted
- Full-screen popups begging you to pay
- Any other bloatware
